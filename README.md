This project takes the footprints.geojson file and turns it into a CityJSON format. 
The extruded_footprints.json is the outputted CityJSON file. It uses the nlohmann library to handle the json format. 
The library folder is already included in this project. To run this project, simply pull it from GitHub and run main.cpp.
